# Mapify

Mapify is a web application that provides a map-based interface to help users explore different travel destinations and share their experiences with other users. The application is developed using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

The main feature of the application is a map display that allows users to add markers to specific locations on the map. These markers can represent various travel destinations such as tourist attractions, restaurants, hotels, or any other interesting places. When a user clicks on a marker, they can view more details about the place, including photos, reviews, and ratings.

Users can create their own profiles and add reviews for the places they have visited. The review system is based on a five-star rating scale and allows users to provide detailed feedback about their experiences. Users can see the reviews left by other users, which can help them make informed decisions about which places to visit.

The application is integrated with various third-party APIs for map display.
